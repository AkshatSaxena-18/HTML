            <h2><b><u> When it is celebrated </u></b></h2>

            <p> Vijayadashami (Sanskrit: विजयादशमी, romanized: Vijayadaśamī), more commonly known as Dussehra, and also known as Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Durga Puja and Navaratri. It is observed on the tenth day of the month of Ashvin, the seventh in the Hindu lunisolar calendar. The festival typically falls in the Gregorian calendar months of September and October.

                Vijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent. In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, commemorating goddess Durga's victory against the buffalo-demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma. In the northern, central, and western states, it marks the end of Ramlila and commemorates the deity Rama's victory over the demon-king Ravana. Alternatively, it marks a reverence for one of the aspects of goddess Devi, such as Durga or Saraswati.
                
                Vijayadashami celebrations include processions to a river or ocean front that involve carrying clay statues of Durga,[ Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya, accompanied by music and chants, after which the images are immersed in the water for dissolution and farewell. In other places, towering effigies of Ravana, symbolising evil, are burnt with fireworks, marking evil's destruction. The festival also starts the preparations for Diwali, the important festival of lights, which is celebrated twenty days after Vijayadashami.</p>

            <h2><b><u> What you do on this day </u></b></h2> 
            <p>1. Wear new clothes to be rewarded with 10 new sets of clothes. Hindus believe that you will receive these new clothes in the year ahead only if you sport unworn ones on the day of Dussehra. The brighter and more vibrant, the better.
                <ul>
               <li> Most jewelry worn during the festival is gold, since gold is considered the god's metal.</li>
                <li> Women wear colorful sarees while men often wear kurtas and sherwanis. Choose fabrics with intricate borders and embroideries to get in the festive spirit.</li>
            </ul>
            </p> 
            <p>2. Prepare a feast with traditional Indian fare and sweets. Invite your relatives and friends to your home for a meal full of Mysore favorites like masala dosa (Indian crepes), luchis (fried flat breads), or rava idli (steamed semolina cakes). And no meal is complete without sweets, can be given to friends as gifts or even offered to the gods.
                <ul>
               <li> Sweets are so popular on Indian holidays because they're believed to bring good luck.</li>
                <li>Some of the most common Dussehra sweet treats include besan ladoos, badam halwa, and kheer khas khas. You can also try preparing some home-made peda for that authentic Indian touch.</li>
